# NGK-Assignment-3
This is a bigger assignment hand-in exercise we've made in the 3rd semester of my bachelor in softwareengineering.

We have been using RESTinio library for C++ in order to make the Websocket/API, while our client code consists of HTML and JavaScript. 
The server to client interaction was then tested through Postman application at first, but thorugh our own client code, we managed to make our own server to client interaction.
